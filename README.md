# CLI Lab - Week 10 Mini Project

## Python vs Rust Speed Test

The purpose of this project is to use PySpark to perform data processing on a large dataset.

# Dataset Overview:

The [dataset](https://wri-dataportal-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/manual/global_power_plant_database_v_1_3.zip) is a comprehensive, open source dataset of power plants around the world. It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare and draw insights for oneâ€™s own analysis. The database covers approximately 35,000 power plants from 167 countries and includes thermal plants
